HOW TO TAKE SCREENSHOT(WEBPAGE)-
1]Downcasting - TakesScreenshotAs ts=( TakesScreenshotAs) driver;
2]To access and Store these three types we have to use a Interface called Output.
	File tempfile = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE)
		-FILE
		-Base64
		-Byte
	
3]getAbsolutepath- System.out.println(tempfile.getAbsolutePath());
	-to locate the Screenshot in the system.
	
4]Thread.sleep(90000) (TEMPORARY SOLUTION)
	-DeleteOnExit() will delete the screenshot after the program exits.
	-To overcome this problem we have to use thread.sleep so that the program runs for a longer time.
	-It is a temporary Solution
s
5](PERMANENT SOLUTION) 
	-Manually create a folder inside Project 
	-Create an object of FILE 
	-File destinationfile = new File("./{foldername}/{SSname.jpg/png}");
	-To move the file from the temporary location to permanent Location
		-tempfile.renameTo(destinationfile);

6]Refresh the Project
